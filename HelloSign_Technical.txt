*** "Love"

Assignment:

Using programming language of your choice, write a method (or function) that takes two string parameters:
* String:wordToBeFound
* String:toBeSearched

Returns: an integer count of finds for String:wordToBeFound in String:toBeSearched.


Example 
Input
wordToBeFound = “love”
toBeSearched = “What the world needs now is love, sweet love”

loveFunction(wordToBeFound,toBeSearched) => 2




*** Flaky

// The code below is a Pseudo Code Selenium Problem:
// We have found it to be  flaky: 
//   * sometimes it works
//   * sometimes it fails the findElement() for the form input element
//   * sometimes the sendkeys() does not seem to "take" and then the click() fails to submit the form
// TODO => make this reliable
//
//  * Please pseudo-code solution(s)
//  * Please enter comments with the pseudo-code to explain 

WebDriver driver = DriverManager.newDriver()

driver.open(someUrl)
// sleep 15
// get status of page load and see page is loaded completely

WebElement theForm = driver.findElement(By.someBy("formLocator"))
//


WebElement emailInputField = theForm.findElement(By.someBy("emailInputLocator"))

theInputField.sendkeys("someone@somedomain.test")

WebElement submitButton = theForm.findElement(By.someBy("submitButtonLocator"))

submitButton.click()




****"Soccer Foot Ball"
By an odd set of circumstances, our normal software engineering efforts are interrupted so that we can create a very special Foot Ball (Soccer) ⚽ for the Paradise Youth Foot Ball Tournament.  

You are assigned to prepare a set of quality checks (tests) for the Foot Ball prototype.

How do you proceed?

<<  please type short answers here>>
Test Strategy - How are we testing soccer ball properies (unit tests), functional, stress test, performance test, longevity tests

What are some of the tests that you would include?

<<  please type short answers here>>
Unit Test
Leather (Type, Thickness, Patterns)
Stitches (Threads)
Inflator (Material)
Mix of Colors

Functional Test
Whether ball can be inflated
How much force we need to provide for inflating the ball?
 - How many times we need to pump
After inflation, how long does the ball stays inflated in ideal condition

Stress Test

Performance Test

Longevity Test

Look and Feel Test
Visibility of colors during different day light conditions
